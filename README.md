### Building from Source

NOTE: Fallout 4 doesn't build on this branch currently, only attempt building Skyrim for right now.

Requirements:
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)
- [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started.html)

Make sure you've initialized the submodules in this project, i.e. `git clone --recurse-submodules` when cloning.

1. Install Visual Studio 2022 with C++ support (i.e. "Desktop development with C++" option in the installer)
2. Install vcpkg, and run `vcpkg integrate install` to enable it system-wide.
3. Open the solution in VS2022.
4. Right-click on the Skyrim project, click "Build". This should auto-download and install the required vcpkg dependencies, and then build the project.

When using this with `papyrus-lang`, this goes in the "<Skyrim>/Data/SKSE" folder.
